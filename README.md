# Travel Buddy

This application utilizes Node.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & Jquery

This full-stack application implements friend matching based on the user's responses to a ten question survey. The user responds to questions with values from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) around the theme of traveling. When the survey is submitted, the sums of their survey answers are compared against other users and returns the most alike user to travel with.
